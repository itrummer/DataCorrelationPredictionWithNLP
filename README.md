# DataCorrelationPredictionWithNLP
In this project, I try to predict data correlations by analyzing column names. Such methods can be useful, for instance, for database tuning as correlations make optimization hard. I use pre-trained language models, based on the transformer architecture, for the prediction.

This code relates to the following papers:
